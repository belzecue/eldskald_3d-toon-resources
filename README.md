# 3D Toon Resources

WIP

## Open source resources

I read code from a lot of people around to learn their techniques, adapt and apply them in other places. Some code remains mostly unmodified, others are heavily changed, others are somewhat used in other places, mostly adapting the technique.

- Roystan's [Unity Toon Shader Tutorial](https://roystan.net/articles/toon-shader.html#) as a learning basis, heavily modified.
- GDQuest's [Godot Shaders](https://github.com/GDQuest/godot-shaders) for the flames, outlines, and possibly more.
- Miziziziz's [water](https://youtu.be/PLCGL3RW548), adapted from [Harry Alisavakis's](https://halisavakis.com/category/blog-posts/my-take-on-shaders/) Unity tutorials.

Other than code, I took some textures as well. Some are noise textures for the MIT shaders above available on their source codes, others are CC0 normal maps freely available on [3dtextures.me](https://3dtextures.me/), like the water normal map on assets/water/Water_001_NORM.jpg and everything at assets/textures is from [cc0textures.com](https://cc0textures.com/).
