# 3D Toon Resources

WIP

## Open source resources

I read code from a lot of people around to learn their techniques, adapt and apply them in other places. Some code remains mostly unmodified, others are heavily changed, others are somewhat used in other places, mostly adapting the technique.

- GDQuest's [Godot Shaders](https://github.com/GDQuest/godot-shaders) for the flames, outlines, and possibly more.
- Miziziziz's [water](https://youtu.be/PLCGL3RW548), adapted from [Harry Alisavakis's](https://halisavakis.com/category/blog-posts/my-take-on-shaders/) Unity tutorials.
- Sea texture by [Berserkitty](https://www.deviantart.com/berserkitty/art/Seamless-Cartoon-styled-Water-Texture-743787929).
